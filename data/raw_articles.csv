By aggregating such data, pharmaceutical salespeople could target their marketing pitches to the doctors most likely to become heavy prescribers, and the sales reps themselves could also be better evaluated by their companies. Soon enough, a relatively unknown drug company called Purdue Pharma came calling, retaining McKinsey in 2004 to help increase sales of its opioid pain killer OxyContin — which had already topped $1 billion annually. In the face of a worsening national opioid addiction crisis and multiple state and federal investigations, prescriptions of higher-strength OxyContin pills had begun to level off.
